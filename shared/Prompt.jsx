Each object must contain:
- "recipeName": the name with an emoji
- "description": a 2-line summary
- "ingredients": a list of ingredient names (no measurements)

Guidelines:
- Use the user's input to guide the theme of all 3 recipes.
- If the user includes "veg" or "vegetarian", exclude all meat, seafood, and eggs.
- Do NOT wrap the response in backticks or markdown formatting.
- Do NOT include plain strings â€” return an array of JSON objects only.
- Output only the JSON. No intro, no explanation.`,
